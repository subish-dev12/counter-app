Undo/Redo functionality - Allow users to step back through their history or redo actions without manually resetting, giving more control over their counting journey.

Counter presets - Quick buttons for common step values (±1, ±5, ±10) so users don't always need to manually enter the value.

Statistics dashboard - Show stats like highest count reached, lowest count, total operations performed, and average step size.

Keyboard shortcuts - Support arrow keys or +/- keys to increment/decrement for faster interaction without clicking buttons.

Dark mode toggle - Let users switch between light and dark themes, especially useful for extended usage.

Counter limits/boundaries - Allow users to set minimum and maximum count values to prevent going beyond certain thresholds.

Full history view - Currently showing only the last 3 items. Add a modal or expandable section to see the complete history with timestamps.

Export history - Download count history as CSV or JSON for record-keeping or analysis.

Multiple counters - Allow users to create and manage several independent counters simultaneously.

Persistence - Save counter state and history to localStorage so it survives page refreshes.

Which of these interests you? I'd be happy to help implement any of them!
